## Hello


I am currently developing my skills as a data analyst: completing a Bootcamp in Machine Learning and Ai at Gateshead College and working on self-defined data analysis projects. The Bootcamp expanded my knowledge and skillset, allowing me to utilise ML models on large datasets, giving deeper insights and maximising the data’s potential. Working on these projects has got me excited about data and the potential it can unlock within many areas of research, and has motivated me on my journey to become a data analyst.
