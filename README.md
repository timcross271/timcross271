## Hello

I am currently developing my skills as a data analyst, utilising Python to work on a self-defined project using World Bank data to look at possible indirect factors affecting CO2 Emissions. This project really made me excited about data and the potential it can unlock for so many areas of research and has motivated me on my journey to become a data analyst.
