#### Previous Work Experience
- Bulk Oil Buying Scheme (Business Support Manager)\

I generated visualisation for monitoring the scheme, which were used to communicate the scheme’s performance internally and to external stakeholders.

While planning the opening of a new centre, I utilised the large membership and attendance dataset to plan opening times and staff levels, to maximise efficiency and footfall.
